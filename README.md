Hello there! My name is Oluwasegun Ayomide Ajayi( *Ayo* for short ), and I am a web developer and blockchain enthusiast. I have experience in a variety of technologies, including Golang, Node.js, TypeScript, Solidity, and more. I am passionate about building decentralized applications and exploring the potential of blockchain technology. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and experimenting with new technologies. I so do some technical writing and Play chess. Check out my repositories to see some of the exciting projects I'm currently working on. Let's build the future together!
