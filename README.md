### ✨ About Me

I’m **Kistian Egger** — a **software engineer** focused on execution, systems thinking, and building software that actually works in the real world.

I operate across **advanced frontend engineering**, **backend & systems development**, and a growing transition into **AI/ML-enabled systems**. I’m interested in how ideas move from concept → architecture → production, and what it takes to keep systems reliable, performant, and maintainable over time.

I learn new things very fast. I consume large amounts of information, synthesize ideas quickly, and turn them into working systems. My mindset has shifted from “having many interests” to **executing across disciplines** — closer to a *polymath approach* than passive curiosity.

### ✨ What I’m Currently Building & Exploring

- 🔭 A **file-sharing and management system in Go**  
  Designed with concurrency, performance, storage workflows, clean APIs, and real-world constraints in mind.

- 🧠 A **manager / orchestration-style backend system in Go**  
  Exploring service coordination, graceful shutdowns, reliability, and system boundaries.

- 🎨 Frontend-heavy applications using **React, TypeScript, and modern tooling**  
  Focused on architecture, performance, animations, and user experience — not just visuals.

- 🤖 A deliberate transition into **AI/ML-powered systems**  
  Practical applications such as automation, intelligent features, and developer-facing tools.

- ✍🏽 Technical writing  
  Breaking down complex engineering topics (systems, tooling, runtimes, architecture) into clear, usable ideas.

### ✨ Engineering Principles

I value software that:
- Makes tradeoffs explicit  
- Handles failure gracefully  
- Separates concerns cleanly  
- Performs well under load  
- Feels simple because complexity was handled intentionally  

I aim to build systems that scale in **users, complexity, and time**.

### ✨ Technologies & Tools

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, React Native  
- Modern CSS, animations, 3D, performance optimization  
- Tooling: Vite, Webpack, Babel

**Backend & Systems**
- Go (primary focus)  
- Node.js  
- RESTful APIs, service design  


**Data & Infrastructure**
- MongoDB, Redis
- Postgresql
- Docker  
- AWS  
- Linux  

**AI / ML**
- Python-based experimentation  
- Integrating intelligent features into production systems
- Learning how to build ML models

### ✨ Beyond Engineering

- 🏃🏽 Running & 🏊🏽 Swimming
- ✍🏽 I Write both 
- 🎬 Watching classic films and older movies  
- 📚 Reading fiction and historical books  
- 🧠 Studying psychology and philosophy  
- 📷 Interest in cinematography & photography  

If I weren’t an engineer, I’d be working in a creative field. I have a strong eye for **design**, understand **color and visual balance**, and care deeply about how things *look and feel*. This perspective directly influences how I design interfaces and systems.

### ✨ Personal Notes

- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him  
- ⚡ Fast learner with a bias toward execution and shipping real systems
